# PSG2 2024 LECTURER GUIDE


### Create and configure repository
 - Create Github Repository
 - In the main branch, create info.yml file. For more details on how to set up your info.yml. Here is the template.

The Governify auditor should be present on the private tools in order to have access to your information:
 - GitHub: If your repository is public or it is present on your organization there is no need to add the auditor. If not, you'll need to add him by going to Settingsâ†’Manage access on your repository and click on the green button labeled as `Invite a collaborator`. Enter `governifyauditor` and accept.

Bear in mind that you might need to wait for the Governify auditor to accept the invitations in order for the points to appear in the dashboard.
